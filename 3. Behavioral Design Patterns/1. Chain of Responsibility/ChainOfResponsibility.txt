It is a behavioural design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. 
This pattern promotes loose coupling between the sender (client) of a request and it's receivers (handlers), 
making it easier to add or remove handlers and change the order in which they process requests.
