These patterns focus on communication between objects and how they interact.

1. Chain of Responsibility : Passes a request through a chain of handlers.

2. Command : Encapsulates a request as an object.

3. Iterator : Provides a way to traverse a collection without exposing its structure.

4. Mediator : Centralizes communication between objects.

5. Observer : Defines a dependency so one change updates multiple objects.

6. Interpreter : Defines a grammar for interpreting expressions.

7. State : Changes an objectâ€™s behavior based on its state.

8. Template : Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass.

9. Strategy : Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime.
