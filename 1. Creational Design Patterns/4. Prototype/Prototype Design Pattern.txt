Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while kepping performance in mind.
This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object.

The prototype pattern use when creation of object directly is costly. For example, an object is to be 
created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, return it's clone on next request and 
update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.
