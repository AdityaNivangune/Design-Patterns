These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reusability.

1. Singleton : Ensures only one instance of a class exists.

2. Factory Method : Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.

3. Abstract Factory : Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. Prototype : Creates objects by copying an existing object.

5. Builder : Constructs complex objects step by step.
