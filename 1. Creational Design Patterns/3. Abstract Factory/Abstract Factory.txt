Abstract Factory Pattern works around a super factory which creates other factories. 
This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under 
Creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of 
related object without explicitly specifying their classes.
