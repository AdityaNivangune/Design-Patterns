A design pattern refers to an established and verified solution for a 
repetitive issue in software development. 
It offers a standardized approach to solve common design problems and 
helps developers write maintainable, extensible, and reusable code.

The design patterns can be classified into three main categories :
	- Creational Patterns : Deals with object creation mechanism.
	- Behavioral Patterns : Deals with the composition of classes or objects.
	- Functional Patterns : Deals with communication between objects.
